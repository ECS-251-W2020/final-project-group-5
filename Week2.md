<strong>Activities in the past week:</strong>
1. Ran a benchmark for the current performance of a normal run of ResilientDB.

3. We had a planned discussion within ourselves and learnt that the implementation of reference committee 
creation is not absolutely clear in the paper.
4. We brainstormed as to how they could have possibly implemented the reference committee part.
