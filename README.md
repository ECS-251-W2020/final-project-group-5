# final-project-group-5

Fault tolerance and scalability are the two major limitations of most distributed 
systems. In this project, we intend to show that sharding is a prominent solution 
to these limitations in distributed transaction processing, specifically for 
permissioned blockchain systems. We would achieve this by implementing a sharding
 protocol called [AHL (Attested HyperLedger)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3299869.3319889?casa_token=9ZfvUyM5MDYAAAAA:9diBDnkjtQ7M2EjV-ObwPtnTqZnJtyiuXWyUlbMK6hiDSgMkn4i48wOS9yUjfTNr4cTRPO4090s) 
 in ResilientDB. AHL makes use of Trusted Execution Environment to improve 
 fault-tolerance and sharding to enhance performance and scalability. 
 ResilientDB is a high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system. 
 Our ultimate aim is to show improvements in fault-tolerance and scalability of 
 ResilientDB by implementing AHL.
