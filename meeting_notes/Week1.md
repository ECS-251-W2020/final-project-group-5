# Week 1 Summary
<strong>Activities in the past week:</strong>\
The group worked on writing the project proposal. Prior to this, we had a 2-hour
discussion on ideas about the possible topics we could take up for the research 
project. We decided on implementing a sharding protocol and conducted a 
literature review. In the next meeting, we came to a consensus that we would be 
implementing the AHL protocol. We created the first draft based on the points we
had noted down from our discussions. Upon proofreading, we were unhappy with a 
couple of paragraphs and then iteratively improved them until we were satisfied.
We created a board on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jXv54U3m/ecs-251-project) to
structure our planning. Also, joined the [GitHub](https://github.com/ECS-251-W2020/final-project-group-5) 
project group for ECS 251.

<strong>Activities planned for this week:</strong>\
On Thursday, Feb 13, we plan to have a thorough discussion of the AHL paper to 
find gaps in our understanding and rectify them. Next, we will work on decomposing 
our first objective (Improving the performance of Resilient DBâ€™s PBFT for 
intra-shard transactions) into smaller problems so that we can individually work 
on different components.

<strong>Issues:</strong>\
There is already a GitHub repo for ResilientDB which would prefer to work on: 
[ResilientDB](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb). Are we required to 
use the GitHub project group?
